//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
const classic = ["gbh", "best", "normal"];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

const bestmovie = classic[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

const long = classic.length;

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
const magic = classic[classic.length - 1];
